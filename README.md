# Asobi_Yo — MAI Library Demos

**Asobi_Yo** is a showcase and documentation repository for the **MAI Vulkan wrapper**.  
It contains demos that demonstrate the capabilities of MAI, including graphics, compute, and bindless workflows.

> ⚠️ Note: This repository is separated from the MAI library itself.  
> It includes only the demo code and **does not include dependencies** from `mai_vk`.  
> This keeps the demos lightweight and easy to explore.

## 🖼️ Examples
